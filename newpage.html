    <h3>TOPIC : AN INTRODUCTION ABOUT MYSELF</h3>
    <p>
        When I first started out in the industry, I did not have a lot of technical knowledge. I thought I would pick it up along the way, but after a couple months in the field, I realized I needed to make some changes if I wanted to be able to progress in my career. That is when I decided to pursue a certified development program for developers held around my community.
        With this type of program I was able to learn, not just learn but connect to like minds and set a deadline for my learning to perfection. 
        I looked at the courses I needed to take and created a detailed schedule. Thanks to the small goals I had set along the way and the schedule I had created, 
        I was able to get better in a short period of time, and also got even more advanced. My name is <strong>Enobong Kingsley</strong> and I am an enthusiastic mobile software developer with a couple of experience .A software engineer who constantly seeks out innovative solutions to everyday problems using various programming languages.
        As from now i would be undergoing a few month program with <strong>TAG</strong> in order to enhance my knowledge in Web Development. Thank You!
